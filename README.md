# Shape-Class-cpp

Shape Class â€“ Geometrical shapes are classified on the basis of their dimensions. Circle, Triangle, Square and
Rectangle are most 2D shapes. You have to write a class Shape which can store these four basic 2D shapes. Remember

these shapes are normally associated with the number of sides they have.

Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write
down the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test
code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.
